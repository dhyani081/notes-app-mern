# Notes App with Authentication

This project is a Notes application with a separate backend (Node.js with Express) and frontend (React). It has been updated to include a robust authentication system with separate signup and login pages, JWT-based authentication, and protected routes.

## Project Structure

- `notes-simple-crud-backend/`: Contains the Node.js Express backend.
- `notes-crud-frontend/`: Contains the React frontend.

## How to Run the Application

Follow these steps to set up and run the application locally:

### 1. Backend Setup

Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies:

```bash
cd notes-simple-crud-backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the `notes-simple-crud-backend` directory with the following content:

```
PORT=6000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/notesdb
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key_here
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=1h
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

**Note:** Replace `your_jwt_secret_key_here` with a strong, random string. You can generate one using `node -e 


console.log(require("crypto").randomBytes(32).toString("hex"))` in your terminal.

Start the backend server:

```bash
npm start
```

The backend server will run on `http://localhost:6000`.

### 2. Frontend Setup

Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies:

```bash
cd ../notes-crud-frontend
npm install
```

Start the frontend development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend application will typically open in your browser at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Important Notes for Interview

- **Authentication Flow:** Be prepared to explain the JWT-based authentication flow, including how tokens are generated, stored (localStorage), sent with requests, and validated on the backend.
- **Protected Routes:** Discuss how `ProtectedRoute.jsx` ensures that only authenticated users can access certain parts of the application.
- **Security Best Practices:** Highlight the use of `bcryptjs` for password hashing, `express-rate-limit` for rate limiting, and `helmet` for setting various HTTP headers to enhance security.
- **Error Handling:** Explain how errors are handled on both the frontend (e.g., displaying error messages to the user) and backend (e.g., global error handler).
- **Code Structure:** Discuss the modular and component-based structure of the React frontend and the clear separation of concerns in the Node.js backend (models, routes, middleware, services).
- **Scalability:** Mention how this architecture can be scaled, e.g., by adding more microservices, using a more robust database solution, or deploying to cloud platforms.
- **Improvements:** Be ready to discuss potential future improvements, such as adding refresh tokens, implementing password reset functionality, or integrating with third-party authentication providers (OAuth).

Good luck with your interview!
